I'm a developer with a keen interest in both creative projects and cutting-edge technology. I've worked on a **DJ Project** where I combined technology with creativity, and I have also gained valuable experience as an **iOS Developer Intern at Chawise**. I'm always looking to learn and grow, and I love exploring new ideas in development.

## Projects

## Internship Experience

- **Chawise â€“ iOS Developer Intern:** During my time at Chawise, I worked on various aspects of iOS development, gaining practical skills in Swift, UI/UX design, and application development. This internship was a fantastic opportunity to work in a dynamic team and contribute to real-world projects.
